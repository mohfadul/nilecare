## üß™ Testing Checklist (Optional - 30 minutes)

For comprehensive testing, run these additional checks:

### Test 1: Rollback Test
- [ ] Run migration
- [ ] Run undo
- [ ] Verify tables removed
- [ ] Re-apply migration
- [ ] See `PHASE1_MIGRATION_TESTING_GUIDE.md` for details

### Test 2: Permission Test
- [ ] Test service user can access own database
- [ ] Test service user CANNOT access other databases
- [ ] Test readonly user can SELECT from all databases

### Test 3: Data Preservation Test
- [ ] Insert test data
- [ ] Run migration (if schema changes)
- [ ] Verify data still exists

---

## üìä Completion Verification

### Database Status

```bash
# Check all databases exist
mysql -u root -p -e "
SELECT 
  SCHEMA_NAME as database_name,
  DEFAULT_CHARACTER_SET_NAME as charset,
  DEFAULT_COLLATION_NAME as collation
FROM information_schema.SCHEMATA
WHERE SCHEMA_NAME LIKE 'nilecare_%'
ORDER BY SCHEMA_NAME;
"
```

**Expected:** 8+ databases listed

### Migration Status

```bash
# Check migration history for each service
cd microservices/auth-service && npm run migrate:info
cd ../billing-service && npm run migrate:info
cd ../payment-gateway-service && npm run migrate:info
```

**Expected:** Each shows 1 successful migration

### Service Health

```bash
# Start all services and check health endpoints
curl http://localhost:7020/health  # Auth
curl http://localhost:7050/health  # Billing
curl http://localhost:7030/health  # Payment
```

**Expected:** All return 200 OK with healthy status
