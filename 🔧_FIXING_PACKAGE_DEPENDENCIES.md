## ❌ ISSUE IDENTIFIED

The microservices depend on local packages that need to be built first:

1. `@nilecare/response-wrapper` - API response standardization
2. `@nilecare/service-clients` - Inter-service communication
3. `@nilecare/common` - Shared utilities

**These were created in Phase 2 but need to be built!**

```bash
# Build response-wrapper
cd packages/@nilecare/response-wrapper

# Build common (if exists)
cd packages/@nilecare/common
npm install
npm run build
```

### Step 2: Link or Install in Services

```bash
# Install dependencies in main-nilecare
cd microservices/main-nilecare
npm install
```
