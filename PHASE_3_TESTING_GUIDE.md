# 🧪 Phase 3: Testing & Validation Guide

**Date:** October 15, 2025  
**Purpose:** Validate all Phase 3 features  
**Estimated Time:** 30 minutes

---

## 🎯 Testing Checklist

### ✅ Prerequisites

Before testing, ensure:
- [ ] Docker is running
- [ ] Redis is available (port 6379)
- [ ] Auth service is running (port 7020)
- [ ] Business service is running (port 7010)
- [ ] Orchestrator is running (port 7000)

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Start Phase 3 Infrastructure

```bash
# Start Redis, Jaeger, Prometheus, Grafana
.\scripts\start-phase3-dev.ps1

# OR manually
docker-compose -f docker-compose.phase3.yml up -d
```

**Verify:**
- Redis: `redis-cli ping` → `PONG`
- Jaeger UI: http://localhost:16686
- Prometheus: http://localhost:9090
- Grafana: http://localhost:3030

---

## 🧪 Test 1: Redis Caching

### Test Cache Hit/Miss

```bash
# Get authentication token first
TOKEN="your-jwt-token-here"

# Test 1.1: First request (cache MISS)
curl -w "\nTime: %{time_total}s\n" \
  http://localhost:7000/api/v1/patients \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
# Expected: ~200ms, X-Cache-Enabled: true

# Test 1.2: Second request (cache HIT)
curl -w "\nTime: %{time_total}s\n" \
  http://localhost:7000/api/v1/patients \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
# Expected: ~20ms (10x faster!), X-Cache-Enabled: true

# Test 1.3: Check cache statistics
curl http://localhost:7000/api/v1/cache/stats \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
# Expected: { hits: 1, misses: 1, hitRate: 50, keysCount: 1 }
```

### Test Cache Invalidation

```bash
# Create a patient (should invalidate cache)
curl -X POST http://localhost:7000/api/v1/patients \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "firstName": "Test",
    "lastName": "Patient",
    "nationalId": "TEST123",
    "dateOfBirth": "1990-01-01",
    "gender": "M"
  }'

# Verify cache was invalidated
curl http://localhost:7000/api/v1/cache/stats \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
# keysCount should be 0 (cache cleared)

# Request again (new cache MISS)
curl http://localhost:7000/api/v1/patients \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
# Should be slower (cache rebuild)
```

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ First request: ~200ms (cache MISS)
- ✅ Second request: ~20ms (cache HIT) - **10x faster!**
- ✅ Cache stats show hits/misses correctly
- ✅ Mutations invalidate cache

---

## 🧪 Test 2: Distributed Tracing

### Generate Traces

```bash
# Make several requests to create traces
for i in {1..5}; do
  curl http://localhost:7000/api/v1/patients \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
  sleep 1
done
```

### View Traces in Jaeger

1. Open Jaeger UI: http://localhost:16686
2. Select service: **main-nilecare-orchestrator**
3. Click "Find Traces"
4. Click on any trace to see timeline

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Traces appear in Jaeger UI
- ✅ Shows request → orchestrator → downstream service
- ✅ Spans show timing for each step
- ✅ Can identify performance bottlenecks

---

## 🧪 Test 3: Prometheus Metrics

### View Metrics

```bash
# Get raw metrics
curl http://localhost:7000/metrics

# Should show:
# - http_request_duration_seconds
# - http_requests_total
# - cache_hits_total
# - cache_misses_total
# - circuit_breaker_state
# - process_cpu_seconds_total
# - nodejs_heap_size_total_bytes
# etc.
```

### Query in Prometheus

1. Open Prometheus: http://localhost:9090
2. Try these queries:

```promql
# Request rate (requests per second)
rate(http_requests_total[5m])

# Average response time
rate(http_request_duration_seconds_sum[5m]) / rate(http_request_duration_seconds_count[5m])

# Cache hit rate
rate(cache_hits_total[5m]) / (rate(cache_hits_total[5m]) + rate(cache_misses_total[5m]))

# Active connections
active_connections
```

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Metrics endpoint returns data
- ✅ Prometheus scrapes successfully
- ✅ Queries return data

---

## 🧪 Test 4: API Versioning

### Test v1 vs v2

```bash
# V1 endpoint (simple format)
curl http://localhost:7000/api/v1/patients \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
# Response: { success: true, data: [...] }

# V2 endpoint (with metadata)
curl http://localhost:7000/api/v2/patients \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
# Response: { success: true, data: [...], meta: { version: "v2", timestamp, pagination }}

# Using version header
curl http://localhost:7000/api/patients \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "X-API-Version: v2"
# Should return v2 format
```

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ v1 returns simple format
- ✅ v2 returns enhanced format with metadata
- ✅ Version header works
- ✅ Response includes `X-API-Version` header

---

## 🧪 Test 5: GraphQL Gateway

### Test GraphQL Schema

**Note:** Requires Apollo Server integration (package installation)

If integrated:
```graphql
# Open GraphQL Playground
# http://localhost:7000/graphql

# Test query
query {
  patient(id: "pat_123") {
    firstName
    lastName
    appointments {
      date
      time
      status
    }
    medications {
      name
      dosage
      status
    }
  }
}
```

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ GraphQL playground loads
- ✅ Schema is valid
- ✅ Queries execute successfully
- ✅ Nested resolvers work (patient.appointments)

---

## 🧪 Test 6: Service Discovery

### Test Health-Based Routing

```bash
# Check service status
curl http://localhost:7000/api/v1/services/status \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"

# Should show all services and their health status
# {
#   "auth-service": { "healthy": true, "url": "http://localhost:7020" },
#   "business-service": { "healthy": true, "url": "http://localhost:7010" },
#   ...
# }
```

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Shows all 12 registered services
- ✅ Shows health status (true/false)
- ✅ Shows last health check time
- ✅ Shows failure count

---

## 🧪 Test 7: Circuit Breakers

### Test Circuit Breaker Behavior

```bash
# 1. Stop business service (simulate failure)
# Stop the business service manually

# 2. Try to access appointments
curl http://localhost:7000/api/v1/appointments \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
# Expected: 503 Service Unavailable

# 3. Restart business service

# 4. Circuit should recover automatically
curl http://localhost:7000/api/v1/appointments \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
# Expected: 200 OK (circuit closed again)
```

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Circuit opens when service is down
- ✅ Returns 503 immediately (no waiting!)
- ✅ Circuit closes when service recovers
- ✅ Logs show circuit state changes

---

## 📊 Performance Benchmarking

### Measure Cache Performance

```bash
# Install Apache Bench (if not installed)
# Or use: npm install -g artillery

# Test WITHOUT cache (clear first)
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:7000/api/v1/cache \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"

# Benchmark
ab -n 100 -c 10 -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:7000/api/v1/patients

# Results: ~200ms avg response time

# Test WITH cache (second run)
ab -n 100 -c 10 -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:7000/api/v1/patients

# Results: ~20ms avg response time (10x faster!)
```

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Without cache: 100-200ms average
- ✅ With cache: 10-20ms average
- ✅ Cache hit rate: 80%+
- ✅ Throughput: 10x improvement
