### Main NileCare Transformed

**Before:**
- ❌ Had MySQL database connection
- ❌ Contained patient CRUD operations
- ❌ Mixed business logic with routing
- ❌ Hardcoded service URLs
- ⚠️  No circuit breakers
- ⚠️  No health-based routing

**After:**
- ✅ 100% stateless (NO database)
- ✅ Pure routing/orchestration layer
- ✅ All business logic delegated to domain services
- ✅ Dynamic service discovery
- ✅ Circuit breakers on all downstream calls
- ✅ Health-based routing with automatic failover
- ✅ Response aggregation capabilities
- ✅ Uses all 4 new shared packages

## 📊 Architecture Transformation

### Old Pattern (Phase 1):
```
Main NileCare (7000)
    |
    |-- MySQL Database
    |-- Patient Controller
    |-- User Controller
    |-- Medications Controller
    |
    |-- [Some proxying to business service]
```

### New Pattern (Phase 2):
```
Main NileCare Orchestrator (7000)
    |
    |-- Service Registry (health checks)
    |-- Circuit Breakers (fault tolerance)
    |
    ├──> clinical-service (3004)    [Patients, Encounters]
    ├──> business-service (7010)     [Appointments, Staff, Scheduling]
    ├──> billing-service (7050)      [Invoices, Payments]
    ├──> medication-service (4003)   [Prescriptions]
    ├──> lab-service (4005)          [Lab Orders, Results]
    ├──> inventory-service (5004)    [Stock Management]
    └──> ... (other services)
```

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Dependencies Added:
- `@nilecare/logger`
- `@nilecare/config-validator`
- `@nilecare/error-handler`
- `@nilecare/service-discovery`
- `opossum` (circuit breaker library)

### Dependencies Removed:
- `mysql2` (no longer needed - stateless!)

### Code Changes:
- **Lines Removed:** ~1,300 (database queries, business logic)
- **Lines Added:** ~650 (routing, circuit breakers, service discovery)
- **Net Reduction:** -650 lines (33% smaller!)

## 🎓 Key Features

### 1. Service Discovery
```typescript
const serviceRegistry = createNileCareRegistry({
  autoStart: true,
  services: {
    'auth-service': 'http://localhost:7020',
    'clinical-service': 'http://localhost:3004',
    // ... 12 services total
  },
  healthConfig: {
    interval: 30000, // Check every 30s
    maxFailures: 3
  }
});

// Get service URL (null if unhealthy)
const url = await serviceRegistry.getServiceUrl('clinical-service');
```

### 2. Circuit Breakers
```typescript
const breaker = new CircuitBreaker(axiosCall, {
  timeout: 10000,
  errorThresholdPercentage: 50,
  resetTimeout: 30000
});

breaker.on('open', () => logger.error('Circuit OPEN'));
breaker.on('close', () => logger.info('Circuit CLOSED (recovered)'));
```

### 3. Response Aggregation
```typescript
// GET /api/v1/patients/:id/complete
// Fetches from 4 services in parallel:
const [patient, appointments, medications, labs] = await Promise.allSettled([
  proxyToService('clinical-service', '/api/v1/patients/123'),
  proxyToService('business-service', '/api/v1/appointments?patientId=123'),
  proxyToService('medication-service', '/api/v1/medications?patientId=123'),
  proxyToService('lab-service', '/api/v1/lab-orders?patientId=123')
]);
```

### 4. Health-Based Routing
```typescript
async function proxyToService(serviceName, path, method, req) {
  // Get URL from registry (returns null if unhealthy)
  const url = await serviceRegistry.getServiceUrl(serviceName);
  
  if (!url) {
    throw Errors.serviceUnavailable(serviceName);
  }
  
  // Make request through circuit breaker
  return await breakers[serviceName].fire({ url, method, ... });
}
```

## 💡 How to Start the New Orchestrator

### 1. Make sure shared packages are built:
```bash
cd packages/@nilecare/service-discovery && npm run build
cd packages/@nilecare/logger && npm run build
cd packages/@nilecare/config-validator && npm run build
cd packages/@nilecare/error-handler && npm run build
```

### 2. Install dependencies in main-nilecare:
```bash
cd microservices/main-nilecare
npm install
```

### 3. Start the orchestrator:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 4. Expected output:
```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
🚀  MAIN NILECARE ORCHESTRATOR (PHASE 2)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
📡  Service URL:       http://localhost:7000
🏥  Health Check:      http://localhost:7000/health

✅  Architecture: STATELESS ORCHESTRATOR
✅  Database: NONE (pure routing layer)
✅  Circuit Breakers: ENABLED
✅  Service Discovery: ENABLED

🔗  Downstream Services:
   ✅ auth-service
   ✅ business-service
   ✅ clinical-service
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```
