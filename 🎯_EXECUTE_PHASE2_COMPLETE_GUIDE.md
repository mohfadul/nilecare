## 🚀 Execute Phase 2: Two Methods

### Method 1: Automated (RECOMMENDED ⭐)

```powershell
# Navigate to project
cd C:\Users\pc\OneDrive\Desktop\NileCare

# Test first (Dry Run - no actual changes)
.\scripts\phase2-week3-migration.ps1 -DryRun

# Execute Week 3 (Auth, Billing, Payment)
.\scripts\phase2-week3-migration.ps1

# Time: ~30 minutes
# Result: 3 services migrated, 26 tables moved
```

**What the script does:**
1. ✅ Backs up shared `nilecare` database
2. ✅ Exports auth, billing, payment data
3. ✅ Applies Flyway migrations to new databases
4. ✅ Imports data to service-specific databases
5. ✅ Verifies record counts match
6. ✅ Tests each service starts correctly
7. ✅ Provides detailed status report

---

```

### If Migration Fails

```powershell
# 1. Stop service
# 2. Restore from backup
mysql -u root -p nilecare < backup_before_{service}_*.sql

# 3. Revert configuration
# Edit .env: DB_NAME=nilecare

# 4. Restart service
npm run dev

## 🚀 THREE WAYS TO EXECUTE

### Way 1: Full Automation (Easiest)

```powershell
# Week 3 (All three services)
.\scripts\phase2-week3-migration.ps1

# Weeks 4-6 (Follow plan, one service at a time)
# See PHASE2_COMPLETE_MICROSERVICES_PLAN.md
```

**Time:** Week 3 = 30 min, Full Phase 2 = 6 weeks  
**Difficulty:** ⭐ Easy with automation

---

### Way 2: Manual Step-by-Step (More Control)

```powershell
# Follow detailed guide
code PHASE2_COMPLETE_MICROSERVICES_PLAN.md

# Execute each service manually
# Week 3, Day 1: Auth
# Week 3, Day 3: Billing
# Week 3, Day 5: Payment
# ...continue through Week 6
```

**Time:** Same 6 weeks, more hands-on  
**Difficulty:** ⭐⭐ Moderate

---

### Way 3: Hybrid (Recommended for Production)

```powershell
# Use automation for data migration
.\database\exports\export-all-services.ps1

# Manual for configuration and testing
# More control, less risk

# Follow: PHASE2_COMPLETE_MICROSERVICES_PLAN.md
```

**Time:** 6 weeks  
**Difficulty:** ⭐⭐ Moderate

---
