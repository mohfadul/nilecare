## 🎓 Lessons & Best Practices

### What We Learned

1. **Centralized Auth is Critical**
   - Duplicating JWT secrets is the #1 security anti-pattern
   - Always delegate authentication to a single service
   - Use service-to-service API keys for internal calls

2. **Orchestrators Should Be Lightweight**
   - No database in orchestrator
   - Pure routing and aggregation only
   - Move business logic to domain services

3. **Consistency is Key**
   - Shared packages prevent code duplication
   - Standard patterns make maintenance easier
   - Consistent error formats help clients

4. **Event-Driven Architecture Requires Discipline**
   - Event naming must be standardized
   - All services should participate
   - Event sourcing enables audit trails

5. **Documentation Must Stay in Sync**
   - Port mismatches cause confusion
   - Keep docs as code
   - Auto-generate where possible
