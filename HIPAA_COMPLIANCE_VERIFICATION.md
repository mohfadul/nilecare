## üè• PHYSICAL SAFEGUARDS

### Facility Access Controls (¬ß164.310(a)(1))

**‚è≥ DEPLOYMENT DEPENDENT:**

## üìã PHI PROTECTION SUMMARY

### What is PHI?

**Protected Health Information** includes:
- Patient names
- Medical record numbers
- Diagnoses
- Treatment records
- Billing information
- Lab results
- Prescriptions
- Vital signs

### How NileCare Protects PHI:

**1. Access Control ‚úÖ**
- Only authorized users can access
- RBAC ensures appropriate access
- Doctor sees their patients only
- Nurse sees assigned patients only

**2. Audit Trail ‚úÖ**
- Every PHI access logged
- Who accessed what and when
- Cannot be deleted (soft deletes only)
- Immutable audit records

**3. Encryption ‚úÖ**
- JWT tokens encrypted
- HTTPS ready for transmission
- Database encryption ready
- No plain-text secrets

**4. Data Retention ‚úÖ**
- Soft deletes (data preserved)
- Audit trail permanent
- Compliance with retention policies

## ‚úÖ AUDIT LOG VERIFICATION

**Sample Audit Log Entry:**
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-10-16T10:30:00Z",
  "user_id": "user_abc123",
  "action": "READ",
  "resource": "Patient",
  "resource_id": "patient_xyz789",
  "ip_address": "192.168.1.100",
  "correlation_id": "req_123abc",
  "result": "success"
}
```

**Audit Trail Includes:**
- ‚úÖ Who (user_id)
- ‚úÖ What (action, resource)
- ‚úÖ When (timestamp)
- ‚úÖ Where (IP address)
- ‚úÖ Why (correlation_id for traceability)
- ‚úÖ Result (success/failure)
