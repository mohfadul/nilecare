## 🚀 Execute Phase 2 in 3 Steps

### Step 1: Dry Run (Test Mode - 2 minutes)

```powershell
# Test without making changes
.\scripts\phase2-week3-migration.ps1 -DryRun

# This shows what will happen
# No actual database changes made
```

### Step 2: Execute Week 3 (30 minutes)

```powershell
# Real migration - migrates 3 critical services
.\scripts\phase2-week3-migration.ps1

# Enter MySQL password when prompted
# Wait ~30 minutes
# Verify success messages
```

### Step 3: Verify (5 minutes)

```powershell
# Check services are running
cd microservices\auth-service
npm run dev

# In another terminal
cd microservices\billing-service  
npm run dev

# In another terminal
cd microservices\payment-gateway-service
npm run dev

# Test endpoints
curl http://localhost:7020/health
curl http://localhost:7050/health
curl http://localhost:7030/health
```
