/api/appointment/*
```

Example:

# Via orchestrator (recommended)
GET http://localhost:7000/api/appointment/appointments
```

---

## 🔐 Authentication & Authorization

### Implementation
- ✅ All routes use shared authentication middleware from `shared/middleware/auth.ts`
- ✅ JWT token validation on all protected routes
- ✅ Authorization header format: `Bearer <token>`
- ✅ Token forwarded through orchestrator
- ✅ User context available in all route handlers

### Migration Completed
Old deprecated `middleware/auth.ts` has been completely removed. All routes now use:
```typescript
import { authenticate } from '../../../shared/middleware/auth';
```
