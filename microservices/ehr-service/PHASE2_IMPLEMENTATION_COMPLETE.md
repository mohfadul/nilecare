psql -U postgres -c "CREATE USER ehr_user WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'secure_password';"
psql -U postgres -c "GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE ehr_service TO ehr_user;"

# Run schema
psql -U postgres -d ehr_service -f database/schema.sql
```

## 🔧 Technical Highlights

### Document Lifecycle
```
Draft → Finalized → [Amendment/Addendum]
  ↓         ↓              ↓
Lock     Attest        Version
  ↓         ↓              ↓
Edit     Sign         Audit Trail
```

### Database Performance
- ✅ Indexed for fast queries
- ✅ Soft delete (never lose data)
- ✅ Automatic timestamp updates
- ✅ Connection pooling (20 connections)

### Multi-Facility Support
- ✅ facility_id in all tables
- ✅ organization_id for multi-tenancy
- ✅ Ready for facility isolation

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Sample Data** - Current database has sample documents for testing
   - For production: Configure with real facility/organization IDs
   - Link to actual patients from Clinical Service

2. **MongoDB Optional** - Not required for core functionality
   - Used for advanced document storage and attachments
   - Service works without it (will warn in logs)

3. **Auth Service Required** - Must be running for authentication
   - Uses centralized auth delegation
   - Configure AUTH_SERVICE_URL and AUTH_SERVICE_API_KEY

4. **Document Finalization** - Once finalized, documents are permanent
   - Use amendment process for changes
   - Never delete finalized documents
