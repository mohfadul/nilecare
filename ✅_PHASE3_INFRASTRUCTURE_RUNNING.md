## 🌐 Access Your Monitoring Tools

### 1. Jaeger - Distributed Tracing

**URL:** http://localhost:16686

**What you'll see:**
- Request flows between microservices
- Performance bottlenecks
- Error traces
- Service dependencies

**How to use:**
1. Open http://localhost:16686 in your browser
2. Select a service (e.g., "auth-service")
3. Click "Find Traces"
4. Click on any trace to see details

### 2. Prometheus - Metrics & Monitoring

**URL:** http://localhost:9090

**What you'll see:**
- Real-time metrics
- Performance data
- Service health
- Custom queries

**Sample queries to try:**
```promql
# See all metrics
{__name__=~".+"}

# HTTP request rate
rate(http_requests_total[5m])

# Memory usage
process_resident_memory_bytes
```

### 3. Grafana - Visual Dashboards

**URL:** http://localhost:3030  
**Login:** admin / nilecare123

**What you'll see:**
- Beautiful dashboards
- Real-time graphs
- Custom visualizations
- Alerts

**Setup steps:**
1. Open http://localhost:3030
2. Login with admin/nilecare123
3. Go to Configuration → Data Sources
4. Add Prometheus:
   - Name: Prometheus
   - URL: http://host.docker.internal:9090
   - Click "Save & Test"
5. Create or import dashboards

### 4. Redis - Caching Layer

**Port:** localhost:6379

**What it does:**
- High-speed data caching
- Session storage
- Real-time data

**Test it:**
```powershell
# Using redis-cli (if installed)
redis-cli ping
# Should return: PONG

# Or use Docker
docker exec -it nilecare-redis redis-cli ping
```

## 🚀 What to Do Next

### Option 1: Explore Monitoring Tools (Recommended)

**Try this now (5 minutes):**

1. **Open Jaeger**
   - Go to http://localhost:16686
   - Explore the UI
   - Get familiar with the interface

2. **Open Prometheus**
   - Go to http://localhost:9090
   - Go to Status → Targets
   - Try the "Graph" tab

3. **Open Grafana**
   - Go to http://localhost:3030
   - Login: admin / nilecare123
   - Explore the interface
   - Add Prometheus data source

### Option 2: Start Testing

**Start services and run tests:**

```powershell
# Install dependencies (if not done)
npm install

# Run integration tests
npm run test:integration

# This will:
# - Test service communication
# - Generate traces in Jaeger
# - Create metrics in Prometheus
# - Provide data for Grafana
```

### Option 3: Start Services Manually

**Start services one by one:**

```powershell
# Terminal 1: Auth Service
cd microservices\auth-service
npm install
npm run dev

# Terminal 2: Business Service
cd microservices\business
npm install
npm run dev

# Terminal 3: Billing Service
cd microservices\billing-service
npm install
npm run dev

# etc...
```

### Option 4: Use Automated Script

**Start all services at once:**

```powershell
.\scripts\start-all-services-phase3.ps1
```

## 📊 Understanding Your Monitoring Stack

### The Flow

```
Microservices
    ↓
    ├→ Jaeger (receives trace data)
    ├→ Prometheus (scrapes metrics)
    └→ Redis (caches data)
         ↓
    Grafana (visualizes everything)
```

### What Each Tool Shows

**Jaeger (Tracing):**
- WHERE requests go
- HOW LONG each step takes
- WHICH services are involved
- WHERE errors occur

**Prometheus (Metrics):**
- HOW MANY requests
- HOW FAST responses are
- HOW MUCH resources used
- WHEN issues started

**Grafana (Visualization):**
- GRAPHS of all metrics
- DASHBOARDS for overview
- ALERTS for problems
- TRENDS over time

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Jaeger Tips
1. Use "Find Traces" to search
2. Look for red errors first
3. Sort by duration to find slow requests
4. Click traces for detailed view

### Prometheus Tips
1. Start with simple queries
2. Use the "Graph" tab for visualization
3. Check "Status → Targets" for health
4. Explore "Status → Configuration"

### Grafana Tips
1. Import community dashboards first
2. Customize for your needs
3. Set up alerts on critical metrics
4. Share dashboards with team

### Redis Tips
1. Monitor memory usage
2. Check connection count
3. Use for session data
4. Cache expensive queries

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Can't access monitoring tools?

```powershell
docker ps
```

**Restart if needed:**
```powershell
docker restart nilecare-jaeger nilecare-prometheus nilecare-grafana nilecare-redis
```

### Port conflicts?

**Check what's using ports:**
```powershell
netstat -ano | findstr "16686"  # Jaeger
netstat -ano | findstr "9090"   # Prometheus
netstat -ano | findstr "3030"   # Grafana
netstat -ano | findstr "6379"   # Redis
```

### Docker issues?

**Check Docker is running:**
```powershell
docker info
```

**View logs:**
```powershell
docker logs nilecare-jaeger
docker logs nilecare-prometheus
docker logs nilecare-grafana
```
