1. ✅ **Remove Redundant Code** - Already done in Fix #3 (removed 1,800 lines of duplicate auth)
2. ✅ **Extract Shared Utilities** - Created @nilecare/common, @nilecare/response-wrapper, @nilecare/service-clients
3. ✅ **Consistent Logging** - Winston already implemented across services
4. ✅ **Correlation IDs in Logs** - Done in Fix #10
5. ✅ **TypeScript Throughout** - 100% TypeScript codebase
6. ✅ **Code Cleanup** - Removed backup files

### 4. TypeScript Quality ✅

**Already high quality:**
- 100% TypeScript coverage
- Strong typing throughout
- Interface definitions
- Type-safe API calls

### 5. Logging Standardization ✅

**Winston already deployed:**
