```powershell
# 1. Create exports directory
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path "database\exports\phase2"

# 2. Backup shared database
mysqldump -u root -p nilecare > backup_phase2_week3_$(Get-Date -Format "yyyyMMdd").sql

# 3. Export auth data
mysqldump -u root -p nilecare auth_users auth_refresh_tokens auth_devices auth_roles auth_permissions auth_audit_logs auth_login_attempts --no-create-info --skip-triggers --single-transaction > database\exports\phase2\auth_data.sql

# 4. Apply Flyway migrations
cd microservices\auth-service
npm run migrate:up

# 5. Import data
mysql -u root -p nilecare_auth < ..\..\database\exports\phase2\auth_data.sql

# 6. Verify counts
mysql -u root -p -e "SELECT (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM nilecare.auth_users) as source, (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM nilecare_auth.auth_users) as target;"

# 7. Update configuration
# Edit .env: DB_NAME=nilecare_auth

# 8. Test service
