## 🚀 Execute in 3 Simple Steps

### Step 1: Migrate Auth Service (2 minutes)

```powershell
cd C:\Users\pc\OneDrive\Desktop\NileCare\microservices\auth-service
npm run migrate:up
```

**Creates:** 7 tables in `nilecare_auth` database

---

### Step 2: Migrate Billing Service (2 minutes)

```powershell
cd C:\Users\pc\OneDrive\Desktop\NileCare\microservices\billing-service  
npm run migrate:up
```

**Creates:** 9 tables in `nilecare_billing` database

---

### Step 3: Migrate Payment Gateway (2 minutes)

```powershell
cd C:\Users\pc\OneDrive\Desktop\NileCare\microservices\payment-gateway-service
npm run migrate:up
```

**Creates:** 10 tables + 12 payment providers in `nilecare_payment` database

---

## 📊 What Will Happen

### When You Run Each Migration:

1. **Flyway connects** to database
2. **Creates schema_version** table (tracks migrations)
3. **Applies V1 migration** (creates all tables)
4. **Sets up indexes** and foreign keys
5. **Seeds initial data** (payment providers)
6. **Reports success** ✅

### Total Impact:
- ✅ **3 services** migrated
- ✅ **26 tables** created
- ✅ **3 databases** separated
- ✅ **True microservice architecture** for critical services!

## 🎯 After Week 3 Complete

### You Will Have:
- ✅ Auth Service with independent database
- ✅ Billing Service with independent database
- ✅ Payment Gateway with independent database
- ✅ True microservice pattern for revenue systems
- ✅ Independent deployments enabled
- ✅ Scalability unlocked

### Next:
- **Week 4:** Clinical, Facility, Lab (17 tables)
- **Week 5:** Medication, CDS, Inventory (16 tables)
- **Week 6:** HL7, Testing, Integration (5 tables)

**Total:** 64 tables across 10 services!

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Run one at a time** - Complete Auth before Billing
2. **Check output** - Ensure each migration succeeds
3. **Verify tables** - Check database after each migration
4. **Test services** - Start service after migration
5. **No data yet** - Tables are empty (data migration is separate step)

## 🚨 If Something Goes Wrong

### Migration Fails

```powershell
# Check what happened
npm run migrate:info

# Validate migrations
npm run migrate:validate

# Check database
mysql -u root -p -e "USE nilecare_auth; SHOW TABLES;"
```

### Need to Rollback

```powershell
# Undo last migration
npm run migrate:undo

# Or drop and recreate database
mysql -u root -p -e "DROP DATABASE nilecare_auth; CREATE DATABASE nilecare_auth;"
```
