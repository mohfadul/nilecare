## 🚀 Your Services Are Running!

Since you started `docker-compose up -d`, your databases are starting. Now:

### Step 1: Wait for Databases (30 seconds)
```bash
# Let databases initialize
Start-Sleep -Seconds 30
```

### Step 2: Start Backend Services
```bash
# Start all microservices
npm run dev
```

### Step 3: Test New Endpoints (After Services Start)
```bash
# Test readiness checks (NEW!)
curl http://localhost:3004/health/ready  # Clinical
curl http://localhost:3002/health/ready  # Business
curl http://localhost:3001/health/ready  # Auth

# Test metrics (NEW!)
curl http://localhost:3004/metrics
curl http://localhost:3002/metrics

# All should return 200 OK ✅
