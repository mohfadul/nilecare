cp src/index.enhanced.ts src/index.ts
npm run dev
```

### Step 2: Test It (10 minutes)
```bash
# Health check with request ID
curl -v http://localhost:7020/health 2>&1 | grep X-Request-Id

# Login test
curl -X POST http://localhost:7020/api/v1/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"doctor@nilecare.sd","password":"TestPass123!"}' | jq

# Verify metadata exists
```
