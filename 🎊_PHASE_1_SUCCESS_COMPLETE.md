```powershell
# 1. Verify JWT_SECRET status
Get-ChildItem microservices\*\.env | ForEach-Object {
    $content = Get-Content $_.FullName -Raw
    if ($content -match 'JWT_SECRET=') {
        Write-Host "$($_.Directory.Name): Has JWT_SECRET"
    }
}
# Should only show: auth-service

# 2. Test auth service
curl http://localhost:7020/health

# 3. Get a token
$login = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:7020/api/v1/auth/login" -Method Post -Body '{"email":"doctor@nilecare.sd","password":"TestPass123!"}' -ContentType "application/json"
$token = $login.data.token

# 4. Test any service
