# 🚀 Services Starting - What to Expect

## 📊 Current Status

**Docker Compose:** ✅ Running (databases starting)  
**Backend Services:** ⏳ Starting with `npm run dev`  
**Health Endpoints:** ⏳ Will be available once services start  

---

## ⏳ Why Services Aren't Responding Yet

The services are likely:
1. Installing dependencies (if first time)
2. Compiling TypeScript
3. Waiting for database connections
4. Initializing connections

**This is normal and takes 1-3 minutes on first start**

---

## 🔍 What's Happening

When you ran `npm run dev`, it started:

```javascript
"dev": "concurrently \"npm run dev:clinical\" \"npm run dev:business\" \"npm run dev:data\" \"npm run dev:gateway\""
```

Each service needs to:
1. Install dependencies (if needed)
2. Connect to PostgreSQL
3. Connect to Redis
4. Initialize Kafka producers
5. Start HTTP server

---

## 🎯 What to Do Now

### Option 1: Wait and Monitor (RECOMMENDED)

Give services 2-3 minutes to start, then test:

```bash
# Wait a bit more
Start-Sleep -Seconds 60

# Test health endpoints
curl http://localhost:3004/health
curl http://localhost:3004/health/ready
curl http://localhost:3004/metrics
```

### Option 2: Check Service Logs

Open the terminal where `npm run dev` is running to see:
- ✅ "✅ Service: clinical-service" - Service started
- ✅ "✅ Database connected" - DB connection OK
- ❌ "Missing env vars" - Needs .env file
- ❌ "Database connection failed" - DB not ready

### Option 3: Start Services Individually (Easier to Debug)

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start databases first
docker-compose up -d
Start-Sleep -Seconds 30

# Terminal 2: Clinical service
cd microservices/clinical
npm install
npm run dev

# Watch for:
# ✅ Environment variables validated
# ✅ Database connected
# ✅ Service started on port 3004
```

## ✅ What to Expect When Services Start

### Improved Startup Messages (NEW!)

```
╔═══════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║   CLINICAL SERVICE STARTED                        ║
╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
✅ Service: clinical-service
✅ Version: 1.0.0
✅ Port: 3004
✅ Environment: development
✅ Started at: 2025-10-09T12:34:56.789Z
✅ Health (liveness): http://localhost:3004/health
✅ Health (readiness): http://localhost:3004/health/ready  ← NEW!
✅ Health (startup): http://localhost:3004/health/startup  ← NEW!
✅ Metrics: http://localhost:3004/metrics                  ← NEW!
✅ API Docs: http://localhost:3004/api-docs
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

### If Environment Variables Missing (NEW!)

```
╔═══════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║   ENVIRONMENT VALIDATION FAILED                   ║
╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
❌ Missing: DB_HOST
❌ Missing: DB_PASSWORD
Error: Missing required environment variables: DB_HOST, DB_PASSWORD
```

**This is GOOD!** It means fail-fast validation is working ✅

## 🧪 Once Services Are Running

### Test NEW Endpoints

```bash
# 1. Readiness checks (validates DB connection)
curl http://localhost:3004/health/ready

# Expected:
{
  "status": "ready",
  "checks": {
    "database": { "healthy": true, "latency": 15 }
  },
  "timestamp": "2025-10-09T...",
  "uptime": 120
}

# 2. Startup checks
curl http://localhost:3004/health/startup

# Expected:
{
  "status": "started",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-09T...",
  "uptime": 120
}

# 3. Metrics (Prometheus format)
curl http://localhost:3004/metrics

# Expected:
clinical_service_uptime_seconds 120
db_pool_total_connections 2
db_pool_idle_connections 1
db_pool_waiting_requests 0
db_pool_utilization_percent 50.00
```

---

## 🎯 Complete Verification

### After Services Start (5 minutes)

```bash
# 1. Test multiple services
curl http://localhost:3004/health/ready  # Clinical
curl http://localhost:3002/health/ready  # Business
curl http://localhost:3001/health/ready  # Auth

# 2. Check metrics
curl http://localhost:3004/metrics
curl http://localhost:3002/metrics

# 3. Run architecture validation
cd testing
npm install
npm run validate:architecture

# Expected: ✅ ALL SERVICES HEALTHY

# 4. Run integration tests
cd integration
npm install
npm test

# Expected: ✅ 150+ TESTS PASSING
```
